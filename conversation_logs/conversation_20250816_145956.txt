User: tell me the total of starbucks transaction each month  for the year 2024

Bot: Based on the provided transaction data, I found the following Starbucks transactions for 2024:

1. May 2024: £416.39
2. July 2024: £361.01
3. October 2024: £948.74
4. December 2024: £745.61 + £78.20 = £823.81

There's also another transaction in December 2024 mentioned in the initial list but it seems incorrect as it's mentioned after the correct one.

To calculate the total for each month in 2024 (excluding the mentioned transactions as the correct ones), we'll need to consider the entire database for 2024, which may contain more Starbucks transactions.
